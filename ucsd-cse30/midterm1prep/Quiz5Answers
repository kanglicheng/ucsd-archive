2. What is the decimal representation of the signed magnitude binary number
1100 0100?
	Negative
	4 + 64 = 68
	Answer = -68

3. What is the result of adding 0x10F and 0x214 (both are hexidecimal numbers)
	
	10F
	214
	---
	323
	F + 4 = 19 - 16 = 3 carry the 1
	1 + 1 = 2
	1 + 2 = 3

4. What is the I (capital-i) but usually for in data-processing instructions 
   in ARM?

	I is set when Src2 contains an immediate
	Ans: It specifies whether the second argument will be an 
	     immediate value or a register

5. The machine encoding of a branch instruction can express changing the program 
   counter to any 32-bit address.
	True


6. Which of the following instructions set condition flags, but don't change 
   the values in any registers?
	options:
		subs r1, r2
		cmp r1, r2
		sub r1, r2
		bne loop

	subs obviously changes the register values as well as CSPR
	sub r1, r2 is shorthand for sub r1, r1, r2 so that means it 
		changes the values of registers
	cmp throws away the result of the sub so it sets the CPSR but doesnt change the registers
	bne is not a valid answer

7. Which of the following condition mnemonics means "The overflow bit AND the 
   zero bit are set"?
	N V 
	0 0
	0 1
	1 0
	1 1  

	options:
		NE !Z
		PL !N
		GE !(N eor V)
		HS  C
		None of the above

	None of the above


8. The difference in the machine instructions for "sub r1, r2, r3" and 
   "subne r3, r2, r3" is in... (choose ALL that apply)
	options:
		Bit 20 (the S part)
		Bits 19:16 (the Rn part)
		Bits 31:28 (the cond part)
		Bits 24:21 (the cmd part)
		Bits 15:12 (the Rd part)

	sub r1, r2, r3
	1110000 opcode 0 Rn Rd 00000000 Rm
	1110000 0010 0 0010 0001 00000000 0011

	subne r3, r2, r3
	XXX 00 I cmd S Rn Rd shamt5 sh 0 Rm

	Ans:
	Bit 20 is not set/changed.
	Bits 19:16 are not changed. (self explanatory)
	Bits 31:28 are changed. (cond it changed from al to ne)
	Bits 24:21 is not changed. (cmd is basically the opcode)
	Bits 15:12 (Rd) is  changed. (self explanatory)


9. If logically shifted left by THREE bits using the "lsls" instruction, 
   which of the following examples would set the carry bit? Choose ALL that apply
	options:
		0x00000008
		0x20000001
		0x80000000
		0x10000000
		0x20000002

	Ans:
		0x00000008 does not set the carry bit in a 32-bit register
		0x20000001 
			leftmost nibble: 0010
			3 bits left shift => carry bit set
		0x80000000
			leftmost nibble: 1000
			3 bits left shift => carry bit set
		0x10000000
			leftmost nibble: 0001
			3 bits left shift => carry bit not set
		0x20000002
			leftmost nibble: 0010
			3 bits left shift => carry bit set
