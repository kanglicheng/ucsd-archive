(First two back to back, third one later)
1) Given an array of integers, sort the array, and return an array where result[i] represents the location of the ith element of the original array in the new sorted array.
2) Sort an array of floats, but if two floats have the same integer part they should have equal probability of appearing on either side of each other (e.g. 6.3, 6.5 and 6.5, 6.3 should be equally likely)
1) Given list of ints and a value sum, return a boolean array where each index indicates whether or not that element and another in the list sum up to sum (basically 2-sum)
2) Given list of ints return distance to largest int later in the list (or -1 if no such element)
1) Given two singly linked lists, return the point where they intersect
2) Given a binary search tree and value to split by, return two BSTs - one with all values <= to the split value, one > split value
