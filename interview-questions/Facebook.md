1st Round: Phone Interview (45 Minutes)
1. Design a set of classes to represent a Graph where nodes of a graph contained a generic piece of Data
Write a function to create a deep copy of this graph (Very similar to clone graph on leetcode)
2. Given two arrays, return an array containing the intersection of these two arrays
Followup: What if one array was considerably larger than the other
2nd Round: Onsite (45 Minutes)
1. Very similar to Diameter of Binary Tree on Leetcode, except edges were used to calculate height instead of nodes.
Ex. A binary tree with just one node would have height 0, instead of 1
2. Very similar to Valid Palindrome on Leetcode
