Like a lot of people, was immediately punted into a final onsite as a continuation of last year. Microsoft onsite in Redmond consisted of four rounds, back to back. Each round was ~1 hour. Each round had around 2-3 questions, or 2-3 followups.
PM me for details.

1) Given a list of jobs and servers, where jobs[i] is the resources required by the ith job and servers[i] is the resources available on the ith server, figure out if all jobs can be run by all servers if only one job can run on a server
2) What if multiple jobs can run on a server?
(On site)
1) Design snakes and ladders
2) Within the team we have an app where we can see what hacks other groups are doing, join those hacks, rate people's performance on those hacks, and see our own ratings. Design this app (all parts of MVC - how app would look, how database would look, what API you would have etc.)
1) There is a spaceship and an astraunaut on the spaceship who takes pictures of all the panels on the spaceship 4 times a day. Design a system for collecting this information, analyzing it (using ML techniques to identify damage on the panels) and reporting the health of the spaceship to ground control (same as last question - design all parts of MVC. After basic design was done we spent a lot of time talking about ML techniques we could use to identify damage on a panel using the images).
1) Design connect 4
2) Pick between chess or othello. Design the one you picked. This one was with a hiring manager so we spent some time later talking about what projects etc. I would be interested in, and in what his team did specifically.
1) There are 4 people, one flashlight, and a bridge that takes two people at a time. The people take 1,2,5,8 minutes to cross the bridge alone. You can only cross the bridge if you have the flashlight. Find the optimal way for all 4 of them to cross
2) Reverse a linked list, other miscellaneous linked list questions (she said she was going to ask these but didn't ask because it was my last interview)
